# Test Coverage Progress Summary

## Current Status
- **Starting Coverage**: ~47%
- **Current Coverage**: 61.72%
- **Target Coverage**: 80%
- **Remaining Gap**: 18.28%

## Work Completed
1. Created comprehensive test suites for:
   - Analytics system (client, server, manager, providers, hooks, event schemas)
   - API routes (health, waitlist, analytics track, dev generate-utm, test-monitoring, stripe recover-session)
   - Components (ErrorBoundary, Logo, MonitoringProvider, Analytics, homepage variants)
   - Context providers (SiteModeContext)
   - Email system tests
   - Abandoned cart analytics
   - Cookie consent management

2. Fixed numerous test issues:
   - Corrected mock implementations
   - Fixed import paths for testing libraries
   - Aligned tests with actual implementations
   - Resolved TypeScript and ESLint errors

## Remaining Work to Reach 80%
1. **High-Impact Files** (would add most coverage):
   - app/purchase/page.tsx (server component)
   - app/purchase/success/page.tsx (server component)
   - lib/stripe/checkout.ts
   - lib/email/email-service.ts (partial coverage)
   - components/analytics/ABTestResults.tsx
   - components/analytics/FunnelVisualization.tsx

2. **API Routes**:
   - app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts
   - app/api/sendgrid/webhook/route.ts
   - app/api/validate-utm/route.ts (partial)

3. **Component Tests**:
   - More test cases for existing component tests
   - Edge cases and error scenarios
   - Integration tests

## Recommendations
1. Continue adding tests for the high-impact files listed above
2. Focus on files with 0% coverage first, then improve partial coverage
3. Consider using testing utilities for server components
4. Add integration tests for critical user flows
5. Re-enable E2E tests once unit test coverage is sufficient

## Next Steps
1. Complete unit test coverage to 80%
2. Fix any remaining TypeScript/ESLint issues
3. Re-enable E2E tests in CI
4. Ensure all tests pass consistently
5. Merge to main branch
