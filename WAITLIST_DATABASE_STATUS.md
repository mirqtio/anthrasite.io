# Waitlist Database Status Report

## Current Issues

1. **Local Development**: The waitlist is falling back to in-memory storage because Prisma cannot find the `waitlist` table
2. **Production (Vercel)**: Unknown status - needs verification after environment variable update
3. **RLS Warnings**: Supabase is showing security warnings about Row Level Security not being enabled

## Root Cause

The database connection is working (we can see `prisma:query SELECT 1` succeeding), but Prisma reports:

```
The table `public.waitlist` does not exist in the current database.
```

This suggests either:

- The tables were created in a different schema than `public`
- The tables weren't created successfully
- There's a connection string issue pointing to the wrong database

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables

Upload the new environment variables from `import-vercel-updated.env`:

- This includes proper database URLs (both pooled and direct)
- Sets `USE_FALLBACK_STORAGE=false` to ensure production uses the database
- Includes all necessary Supabase credentials

### 2. Verify Tables in Supabase

In the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Table Editor
2. Check if these tables exist:
   - `waitlist`
   - `businesses`
   - `utm_tokens`
   - `purchases`
   - `analytics_events`
   - `abandoned_carts`

If they don't exist, re-run the SQL script:

```sql
-- Run the contents of prisma/create-tables.sql
```

### 3. Enable Row Level Security

After confirming tables exist, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of prisma/enable-rls.sql
```

### 4. Test Production Deployment

After updating Vercel and redeploying:

1. Test the waitlist form on the production site
2. Check if entries are being saved to the database
3. Monitor Vercel logs for any database errors

## Fallback Behavior

The application has a robust fallback system:

- If database is unavailable, it automatically uses in-memory storage
- This prevents the waitlist from breaking completely
- However, in-memory storage is lost on server restart

## Next Steps

1. **If tables don't exist**: Re-run `create-tables.sql` in Supabase
2. **If tables exist but connection fails**: Check if tables are in the `public` schema
3. **If everything looks correct**: Consider running `prisma db push` after fixing the direct connection URL issue

## Monitoring

Check these logs after deployment:

- Look for "Waitlist entry created (fallback storage)" - indicates database issue
- Look for successful database queries without errors
- Monitor Sentry for any database connection errors
