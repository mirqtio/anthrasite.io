# CI Fixes Implemented

## Tests Re-enabled

### 1. Linting (basic-ci.yml)

- **Before**: `continue-on-error: true` - linting failures didn't fail the build
- **After**: Removed flag - linting now properly fails the build on errors

### 2. E2E Tests (comprehensive-e2e.yml)

- **Before**: Only ran 4 tests: `basic.spec.ts`, `homepage.spec.ts`, `monitoring.spec.ts`, `css-loading.spec.ts`
- **After**: Now runs ALL E2E tests with `npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ci.ts`
- **Impact**: Increased test coverage from 28.6% to 100% (4 tests â†’ 14 tests)

### 3. Code Coverage Upload (ci.yml)

- **Before**: `fail_ci_if_error: false` and `continue-on-error: true`
- **After**: `fail_ci_if_error: true` - CI will fail if coverage upload fails

## Docker Environment Improvements

### 1. Created .dockerignore

- Reduces Docker build context from 2.6GB to ~12MB
- Speeds up builds significantly

### 2. Updated Dockerfile.ci

- Added canvas dependencies required for npm install:
  - build-essential
  - libcairo2-dev
  - libpango1.0-dev
  - libjpeg-dev
  - libgif-dev
  - librsvg2-dev
  - pkg-config

## Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes and push to trigger CI**
2. **Monitor CI results** - some tests may fail now that they're re-enabled
3. **Fix any failing tests** - work through failures systematically
4. **Set up pre-commit hooks** to catch issues before CI

## Important Note

These changes will likely cause CI to fail initially as we've re-enabled all tests. This is expected and desired - we need to see what's actually broken to fix it properly.
