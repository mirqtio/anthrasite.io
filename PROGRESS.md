# Implementation Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

#### ✅ Phase 1.1: Project Setup
- Initialized Next.js 14 with App Router
- Configured TypeScript with strict mode
- Set up Tailwind CSS with Anthracite color palette
- Installed and configured Jest for unit testing
- Set up Playwright for E2E testing
- Configured ESLint and Prettier
- Set up Husky with pre-commit hooks
- Created basic project structure

**Test Coverage**: Unit tests and E2E tests configured and passing

#### ✅ Phase 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- Configured automated testing on PR
- Set up Vercel deployment integration
- Created Docker Compose for local development
- Documented environment variables
- Created comprehensive README

**Key Files**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment pipeline
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

#### ✅ Phase 1.3: Database Schema
- Initialized Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Created complete database schema per PRD:
  - Business model
  - WaitlistEntry model
  - UtmToken model
  - Purchase model
  - AnalyticsEvent model
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Created comprehensive database tests
- Set up seed data for development

**Test Coverage**: 8 database tests passing

### Phase 4: Purchase Flow

#### ✅ Phase 4.3: SendGrid Email Integration
- Installed and configured SendGrid SDK (`@sendgrid/mail`)
- Created comprehensive email service architecture:
  - Email configuration with environment variables
  - Type-safe email data structures
  - Responsive HTML email templates with dark mode support
- Implemented email templates:
  - Order confirmation email with purchase details
  - Report ready notification with download link
  - Welcome email for first-time customers
- Built robust email delivery system:
  - Automatic retry queue with exponential backoff
  - Failed email handling and monitoring
  - Email delivery tracking and analytics
- Integrated with Stripe webhook:
  - Sends order confirmation on successful payment
  - Sends welcome email for new customers only
  - Graceful error handling to prevent webhook failures
- Created SendGrid webhook endpoint:
  - Processes delivery, bounce, complaint events
  - Tracks email opens and clicks
  - Updates purchase metadata with email status
- Comprehensive test coverage:
  - Email service unit tests with mocked SendGrid
  - Template rendering tests
  - Queue and retry logic tests
  - Webhook integration tests

**Key Files**:
- `/lib/email/config.ts` - SendGrid configuration
- `/lib/email/types.ts` - TypeScript types for email data
- `/lib/email/email-service.ts` - Core email sending logic
- `/lib/email/queue.ts` - Retry queue implementation
- `/lib/email/templates/` - Email template components
- `/app/api/sendgrid/webhook/route.ts` - SendGrid event webhook
- Integration with `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

**Test Coverage**: 
- 3 test suites for email functionality
- Mock SendGrid API for reliable testing
- Integration tests for Stripe webhook email sending

**Environment Variables Added**:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@anthrasite.io
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Anthrasite
SENDGRID_REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@anthrasite.io
SENDGRID_REPLY_TO_NAME=Anthrasite Support
SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_KEY=your-webhook-key
SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
SENDGRID_SANDBOX_MODE=true  # For development
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 1.4: Visual Design System
- Implement Anthracite design tokens
- Create core component library
- Set up Storybook for documentation
- Implement animation utilities

### Phase 1.5: Monitoring & Alerting
- Configure Datadog APM
- Set up Sentry error tracking
- Create alert rules
- Establish performance baselines

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start local database: `docker-compose up -d postgres`
3. Set up database: `npx prisma db push && npx prisma db seed`
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`
5. Run tests: `npm test`
6. Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`

## Current Status

The foundation is complete with:
- ✅ Next.js 14 project structure
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Testing frameworks (Jest + Playwright)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Database schema and models
- ✅ Development environment

Ready to proceed with Phase 1.4 (Visual Design System) and Phase 1.5 (Monitoring).
