Use TDD and BDD with browser based e2e tests for validation that requirements are met.
Proper CI/CD should be configured and used with each feature fully tests, issues resolved, and merged to main before moving on to the next feature.
Final dev acceptance includes a full assessment of the codebase against @PRD.md to ensure successfull deliver, running of the comprehensive test suite including browser based e2e test for all features and functions, and confirmation that everything runs green.
Ask if there are any unclear or ambiguous points. Do not make assumptions. Do not work around requirements.
Contniue until the entire plan is completed and verified to be working as expected.
