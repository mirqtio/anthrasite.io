  - text: What exactly do I get? + A focused report showing your 2-3 biggest website issues, their specific impact on your revenue, and exactly what needs to be fixed. One page of critical insights, not 50 pages of data dumps. How is this different from free tools? + Free tools show you hundreds of issues without context. We analyze your specific business, calculate actual revenue impact, and show only what matters. It's the difference between a medical encyclopedia and a doctor's diagnosis. When will I get my report? + We're currently in early access. Join the waitlist and we'll analyze your site as soon as we launch. Early access members get 50% off their first audit. What if I need help implementing fixes? + Your report includes clear next steps. If you need professional help, we can connect you with vetted agencies who specialize in your specific issues.
