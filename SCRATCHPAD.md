# Housekeeping Commit Plan (for Claude)

**Instructions:** The following `git` commands will stage all remaining documentation and configuration changes from the G1-D3 workstream. This commit cleans the working directory before we begin the next feature.

Execute these commands exactly as written:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Update ISSUES.md and SYSTEM.md post-G3/D3

- Updates ISSUES.md to close out issue D3 and reflect the final 3-point estimate.
- Synchronizes SYSTEM.md and other documentation with the state of the codebase after the G-series cleanup and D3 implementation."
```
